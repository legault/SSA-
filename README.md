# SSAplus

This repository contains R code associated with the manuscript "Accounting for environmental change in continuous-time stochastic population models".

# results-figure1.R

This annotated file contains code for reproducing Figure 1 in the manuscript. 

It utilizes the environment functions, located in ~/Environments.

# results-figure2.R

This annotated file contains code for reproducing Figure 2 in the manuscript. It calculates and plots the cumulative distribution functions associated with exponential and logistic growth under a variety of environment change conditions.

It utilizes the environment functions (~/Environments), demographic functions (~/Demographic functions), and intensity functions (~/Intensity functions), and contains functions for calculating CDFS of both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous processes.

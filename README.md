This repository contains R code associated with the paper "Accounting for environmental change in continuous-time stochastic population models".

# results-figure1.R

This annotated file contains code for reproducing Figure 1 in the manuscript. 

It utilizes the environment functions, located in folder "Environments".

# results-figure2.R

This annotated file contains code for reproducing Figure 2 in the manuscript. It calculates and plots the cumulative distribution functions associated with exponential and logistic growth under a variety of environment change conditions.

It utilizes the environment functions (folder "Environments"), demographic functions (folder "Demographic functions"), and intensity functions (folder "Intensity functions"), and also contains functions for calculating CDFS of both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous processes.
